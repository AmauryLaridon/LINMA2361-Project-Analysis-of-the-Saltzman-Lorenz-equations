# LINMA2361-Project-Analysis-of-the-Saltzman-Lorenz-equations

This Github belongs to the project done in the course **LINMA2361 - Système Dynamiques non linéaires : Analysis of the Saltzman-Lorenz equations.**

The file _simu.ipynb_ contains the simulations which are used in the report. The program is written in Julia.

The report can be found at _projet.pdf_

In this program we first will **produce** the famous **Lorenz-map** in order to safely ruling out stable limit cycles in the strange attractor regime of the Saltzman-Lorenz equations. **Then** we will **compute** the **largest Lyapunov exponent** of the system. The **code for these two first simulutions comes from the notes LPHYS2114 - Nonlinear Dynamics from M.Crucifix**. The **famous phase space** of the **solutions** is done. Lastly a personnal **simulation for very high Rayleigh Number** is achieved.
