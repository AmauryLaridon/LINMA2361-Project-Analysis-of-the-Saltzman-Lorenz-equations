# LINMA2361-Project-Analysis-of-the-Saltzman-Lorenz-equations

This Github belongs to the project done in the course __LINMA2361 - Système Dynamiques non linéaires : Analysis of the Saltzman-Lorenz equations.__

The file *simu.ipynb* contains the simulations which are used in the report.

The rapport can be found at *projet.pdf*

In this program we first will __produce__ the famous __Lorenz-map__ in order to safely ruling out stable limit cycles in the strange attractor regime of the Saltzman-Lorenz equations. __Then__ we will __compute__ the __largest Lyapunov exponent__ of the system. The __code for these two first simulutions comes from the notes LPHYS2114 - Nonlinear Dynamics from M.Crucifix__. __Then__ some __new figures would be personally created.__
